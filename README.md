  the larger data munging assignment
  Write a program that asks a user to enter an arbitrarily large
  number at the prompt
## Compute and display:
    Each digit separated by 3 spaces so 67328 becomes 6 7 3 2 8
    The digits sorted and rewritten in ascending order - so 67328
    becomes 23678
    The sum of the odd numbered digits - so 67328 returns 10
    The sum of the even numbered digits - so 67328 returns 16
